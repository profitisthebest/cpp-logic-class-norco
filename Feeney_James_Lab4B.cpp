// Lab 4B Gradebook BEGIN
// Chapter 4 Decisions, Nested If Structures
// 1. Run this BEGIN file. Examine the code and analyze it. Run the program
// multiple times so that each branch is tested and verified. This code works 
// for an A student or a B student. It is not yet finished for a C, D, or F student.
// Review every line of code. 
// Once you fully understand the code add the following modifications
// 2. Complete the code for a grade of C, D or F. 
// Include appropriate comments for a C grade, D grade and an F grade.
// 3. Modify the logic so that if a student earns a D or F in the course, instead of displaying 
// the sentence  "Please see a counselor..." instead display a sentence stating "You must 
// retake the course before registering for advanced courses."
// Test all branches to ensure the program works correctly (Test for an A, B, C, D and F student)
// Submit the .cpp file
